1. On the server, by default, there should be three folders. These are `world`, `world_nether`, and `world_the_end`. These are the important folders. Download these folders.
2. Navigate to your minecraft folder. This can be done by searching for `%appdata%`, then going into the `.minecraft` folder.
3. Navigate to the `saves` folder, and create a new folder of your choosing. This will be called the world folder.
4. Move the contents of the `world` folder into the folder you just created.
5. Create a new folder called `DIM-1` inside of the world folder, and move the contents of `world_nether/DIM-1` to that folder.
6. Create a new folder called `DIM1` inside of the world folder, and move the contents of `world_the_end/DIM1` to that folder.
